      "<div class=\"entry__content\">\n",
      "<div class=\"articleBody\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"><p>Despite all the enthusiastic hyperbole of draft night, the law of averages says we’ll see as many first-round busts as first-round superstars. Will any be good or bad enough to make our list of the best and worst picks for all 32 NFL teams?</p>\n",
      "<p>We looked at every draft from the NFL’s modern era (since 1970) and made our selections, only considering what a player did for the team that drafted them (for instance, Deion Sanders’ titles in San Francisco and Dallas don’t affect his time in Atlanta).</p>\n",
      "<p>And draft position matters – a really bad No. 2 pick is worse than a horrible No. 32 pick.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Dallas Cowboys</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Emmitt Smith, RB (No. 17, 1990)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Bill Thomas, RB (No. 26, 1972) </b></p>\n",
      "<p>In 1988, the Cowboys used their first-round pick on Michael Irvin. The next year, Troy Aikman went No. 1 overall to Dallas. Both are in the Hall of Fame. But the best Dallas pick came in 1990, when Florida’s Emmitt Smith fell to No. 17, was snatched up by the Cowboys and started a career that would lead him to the top of every major rushing category. The worst Dallas pick would have been a lot more fun if Jerry Jones had been allowed to draft Johnny Manziel in 2014. Truth is, the Cowboys of the Jerry era have an excellent first-round track record. Even Russell Maryland, the No. 1 pick in 1990 that’s widely acknowledged as a bust, still spent five seasons in Dallas, made a Pro Bowl and played in three Super Bowl victories.</p>\n",
      "<h3>New York Giants</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Lawrence Taylor, LB (No. 2, 1981)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Cedric Jones, DE (No. 5, 1996)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>Deacon Jones created them. Bruce Smith had the most. But no one is more associated with the quarterback sack than Lawrence Taylor, the fearsome Giants linebacker who ravaged the NFC East (and NFL) for 13 seasons. In 1986, he was awarded the NFL’s MVP, just the second defender to ever win it. (Since then, a quarterback or running back has won every year.) The Giants have been largely immune to early-draft busts, so Jones gets the embarrassing nod.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Philadelphia Eagles</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Jerome Brown, DT (No. 9, 1987)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Mike Mamula, DE (No. 7, 1995)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>The Eagles don’t have a first-round Hall of Famer and won’t for the next few decades, unless someone gets charitable and decides that Donovan McNabb deserves a gold jacket. And while McNabb was the most important player in modern Eagles history (up until three months ago), no one was better than Brown, who made two All-Pro teams in a five-year career that was tragically cut short when he died in a car accident at the age of 27. Mamula wasn’t as awful as the reputation that precedes him, but the fact that Philly took him in the top 10 based mainly on his combine performance – leaving Warren Sapp and Derrick Brooks on the board – was a groundbreaking moment in the history of awful picks.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Washington Redskins</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Darrell Green, CB (No. 28, 1983)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Heath Shuler, QB (No. 3, 1995) </b></p>\n",
      "<p>The amount of candidates for Washington’s worst pick is amazing: Heath Shuler, Desmond Howard, Patrick Ramsey, Robert Griffin III, Michael Westbrook, LaVar Arrington, Carlos Rogers, Bobby Wilson, Andre Johnson and, probably one day, Josh Doctson. What’s exponentially more remarkable is that all those busts have come from just 26 first-round picks. No team that existed before 1995 has made close to 26 – the average is about 48 per team, a handful of teams have made double the picks of the Redskins and only the Bucs and Seahawks (both founded in 1977) have fewer than 40 first-round picks, with 38 and 39, respectively. (The Jags, born in 1995, have made one fewer first-round picks than the Redskins have since the merger.) From 1969 through 1990, Washington made just three first-round picks but made them count: In 1980, Hall of Famer Art Monk was the franchise’s first first-round pick in 12 years. Mark May, a founding member of the Hogs, went in the first round the next year. And in 1983, the team took Green, a tiny speedster from Texas A&amp;I. The rest of Redskins history is, uh, less decorated.</p>\n",

He was a guaranteed star – a safe selection that would surely be catching touchdowns for the Lions for the next decade. Rogers was Randy Moss-like in college, maybe even better. He finished his career with 36 catches and later <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2017/04/19/charles-rogers-says-pain-pills-injuries-ruined-career-not-marijuana/100682576/\">blamed pain pills and injuries for ruining his career.</a></p>\n",

      "<p>There were more fun picks than these two (Randy Moss and Christian Ponder, respectively) but you can’t argue with either McDaniell or Williams. The first was a first-team All-Pro in seven of his 12 seasons in Minnesota and is in the Hall of Fame.

      "<p>Before Ryan, the Falcons had eight playoff appearances in 42 seasons. Under the Boston College product, they’ve made it six times in 10 years, including the first back-to-back appearances in franchise history. Though he’s been mostly forgotten because of sports’ obsession with recency bias, Bruce Pickens had long been regarded as one of the league’s great draft busts.

      "<p>An NFL MVP in 2015, Newton has turned the Panthers from occasional contenders into perennial ones. Julius Peppers was also a great Carolina pick, but he spent some of his best years in Chicago and Green Bay. Rae Carruth has been in prison since 2001 after being convicted on conspiracy charges to murder his pregnant girlfriend (he is expected to be released later this year).</p>\n",

      "<b>Worst pick: Russell Erxleben, P (No. 11, 1979)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>In 1979, the New Orleans Saints made Erxleben the highest-drafted punter in NFL history and the second, and last, to go in the first round. (Ray Guy, the only punter in the Hall of Fame, was the other.) Erxleben’s career was slightly less successful. A three-time All-American punter at Texas (and owner of the longest field goal in NCAA history), he stayed with the Saints for five years before his release. Only once did he finish in the top 10 in the NFL in yards per punt. Since 1979, there’s only been two other punters taken in the second round (and none in the past 22 years). In the 2000s, there’s only been two punters selected in the third round. I’d read a book about the story behind this pick. Well maybe not a book. A tweet – but the 280-character kind.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Derrick Brooks, LB (No. 28, 1995)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Bo Jackson, RB (No. 1, 1986)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>Bo Jackson told the Bucs he wasn’t going to sign if they picked him No. 1 in the ’86 draft. They did it anyway, Bo was true to his word and played baseball. When Tampa’s rights expired, Oakland took Bo in the seventh round in 1987, allowing him to join the team after baseball season.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Arizona Cardinals</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Larry Fitzgerald, WR (No. 3, 2004)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Kelly Stouffer, QB (No. 6, 1987) </b></p>\n",
      "<p>Fitzgerald will retire as one of the most prolific receivers in NFL history and was the offensive centerpiece on a team that came within inches of a Super Bowl title. Stouffer is on the short list of the worst first-round quarterbacks of all time, finishing his career 5-11 with 7 touchdowns, 19 interceptions</p>\n",
      "<h3>Los Angeles Rams</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Jack Youngblood, DE (No. 20, 1971)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Jason Smith, T (No. 2, 2009)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>Youngblood is best known for leading the team to Super Bowl XIV on a broken leg, but that was only a chapter in an equally beastly career that saw him make seven-straight Pro Bowls, five first-team All-Pros and, along the way, started 201 consecutive games. Had sacks been an official stat during his playing days, Youngblood would likely be in the top 10 on the career list. As for Jason Smith, I can’t remember a more anonymous top-three pick of the past decade. He played three seasons in St. Louis before being shipped to the Jets. He was out of the league a year later.</p>\n",

      "<b>Worst pick: Jim Druckenmiller, QB (No. 26, 1997)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>One is arguably the greatest player in NFL history. (It’s not an argument I make, not when part of his greatness is owed to the two men who threw him passes.) The other is arguably the worst first-round quarterback ever. (In terms of numbers, it’s an easy call. No one ever played less than Druck, who made one start and threw just 52 passes in his career. Heck, even Akili Smith got a season’s worth of starts.)</p>\n",
      "<h3>Seattle Seahawks</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Walter Jones, LT (No. 6, 1997)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Rick Mirer, QB (No. 2, 1993)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>Aaron Curry going at No. 4 in 2009 was a laughably bad pick but a quick look at the rest of he first round shows the Seahawks were pretty much cooked either way. So it’s Mirer by default. The Notre Dame star was supposed to be Seattle’s savior and got four seasons to prove it. It was generous to get that much: No first-round QB in the last 25 years who made more than 50 stats had worse numbers.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Buffalo Bills</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Bruce Smith, DE (No. 1, 1985)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Aaron Maybin, DE (No. 11, 2009)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>Smith retired as the all-time leader in sacks with 200 (all but 29 were with Buffalo), making good on the promise he showed when he was taken with the top pick in a loaded 1985 draft. Aaron Maybin was no Bruce Smith <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/education/k-12/bs-md-aaron-maybin-cold-schools-20180108-story.html\">(though he’s made a huge impact on something probably more important than football in his post-NFL career).</a></p>\n",
      "<h3>Miami Dolphins</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Dan Marino, QB (No. 27, 1983)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: David Overstreet, RB (No. 13, 1981) </b></p>\n",
      "<p>Marino made a precipitous drop in the <a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/01/18/When-Dan-Marino-was-coming-out-of-college-his/7140474872400/\">’83 draft thanks to whispers of drug use during his college days at Pitt.</a> Despite the rumors and the presence of David Woodley, a quarterback who was coming off a Super Bowl appearance, Miami took Marino and watched him become the most prolific quarterback in NFL history. Though Overstreet gets the worst pick award, special mention goes to Yatil Green, the hard-luck Miami U receiver selected in 1999 who tore up his knee on the first day of training camp (shades of Ki-Jana Carter), didn’t get on the field until his third year and ended his career with almost as many surgeries (10) as catches (18).</p>\n",
      "<h3>New England Patriots</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: John Hannah, G (No. 4, 1973)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Kenneth Sims, DE (No. 1, 1982) </b></p>\n",
      "<p>Nothing from the era of Belichick and Brady? Nope; the first-round picks from the Pats dynasty have maxed out at “very good” and bottomed at “merely okay.” Hannah was a Hall of Fame guard who had been the best player in Pats history up until that Brady guy. Sims wasn’t horrible, but when you have the No. 1 pick, you expect more than 74 games and five years as a starter. (The best and worst of recent times, in case you were wondering: Richard Seymour and Laurence Maroney, respectively.)</p>\n",
      "<h3>New York Jets</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Darrelle Revis, CB (No. 14, 2007)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Blair Thomas, RB (No. 2, 1990)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>This is as ugly a list as you’d expect. The Jets have picked only one Hall of Famer in the first round and John Riggins made it to Canton based on his later exploits with the Redskins. Revis spent three years as the NFL’s top shutdown corner and even though he only spent six years with the team in his prime (he returned for the last two seasons), it’s enough to put him ahead of guys like Nick Mangold and John Abraham. As for the worst, it’s a rotten cornucopia from which to choose. Thomas, who went No. 2 behind Jeff George in 1990 (oof), wins, a decision that becomes easier when you remember who the second RB drafted was that year – Emmitt Smith.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Baltimore Ravens</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Ray Lewis, LB (No. 26, 1996)</b><br/>\n",

His magical 2011 was capped by a walk-off 80-yard touchdown pass in the playoffs – which, for my money, is one of the most exciting plays in NFL history. Miller was one of the easiest choices on the board, not just because he’s a three-team All-Pro and Super Bowl MVP but because Denver’s first-round history isn’t exactly overflowing with superstars.</p>\n",

      "<p>The second QB taken in the historic 1983 draft was Blackledge, the Penn State star who was taken six picks after John Elway went No. 1 for a team for which he’d never play. Kansas City, of course, missed out on Jim Kelly and Dan Marino. But with Tony Eason and Ken O’Brien also going in the first round, the Chiefs had only a 40% chance of taking a Hall of Famer. Problem is, the Chiefs got the worst of the litter. Blackledge made just 24 starts in KC.</p>\n",

      "<p>Seau played 13 seasons in San Diego, making the Pro Bowl in his final 12 and being named an All-Pro in eight (six first-team selections, two second-team). Leaf played three seasons in San Diego, winning four games in total and throwing for 20 more interceptions than touchdowns.</p>\n",

      "<p>Marinovich is one of the great cautionary tales in sport, showing that for every Tiger Woods or Williams sister who makes good on the borderline sporting abuse of overbearing fathers, there’s an opposite outcome that ends in tragedy. Brown, the first wide receiver to win the Heisman Trophy, was practically molded from an Al Davis dream – a fast, reliable receiver with soft hands who looked good in a football uniform. He was one of the NFL’s greats of the 1990s, the third man to grab 1,000 catches and a Hall of Famer.</p>\n",

      "<div class=\"articleBody\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"><p>Despite all the enthusiastic hyperbole of draft night, the law of averages says we’ll see as many first-round busts as first-round superstars. Will any be good or bad enough to make our list of the best and worst picks for all 32 NFL teams?</p>\n",
      "<p>We looked at every draft from the NFL’s modern era (since 1970) and made our selections, only considering what a player did for the team that drafted them (for instance, Deion Sanders’ titles in San Francisco and Dallas don’t affect his time in Atlanta).</p>\n",
      "<p>And draft position matters – a really bad No. 2 pick is worse than a horrible No. 32 pick.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Dallas Cowboys</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Emmitt Smith, RB (No. 17, 1990)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Bill Thomas, RB (No. 26, 1972) </b></p>\n",
      "<p>In 1988, the Cowboys used their first-round pick on Michael Irvin. The next year, Troy Aikman went No. 1 overall to Dallas. Both are in the Hall of Fame. But the best Dallas pick came in 1990, when Florida’s Emmitt Smith fell to No. 17, was snatched up by the Cowboys and started a career that would lead him to the top of every major rushing category. The worst Dallas pick would have been a lot more fun if Jerry Jones had been allowed to draft Johnny Manziel in 2014. Truth is, the Cowboys of the Jerry era have an excellent first-round track record. Even Russell Maryland, the No. 1 pick in 1990 that’s widely acknowledged as a bust, still spent five seasons in Dallas, made a Pro Bowl and played in three Super Bowl victories.</p>\n",
      "<h3>New York Giants</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Lawrence Taylor, LB (No. 2, 1981)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Cedric Jones, DE (No. 5, 1996)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>Deacon Jones created them. Bruce Smith had the most. But no one is more associated with the quarterback sack than Lawrence Taylor, the fearsome Giants linebacker who ravaged the NFC East (and NFL) for 13 seasons. In 1986, he was awarded the NFL’s MVP, just the second defender to ever win it. (Since then, a quarterback or running back has won every year.) The Giants have been largely immune to early-draft busts, so Jones gets the embarrassing nod.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Philadelphia Eagles</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Jerome Brown, DT (No. 9, 1987)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Mike Mamula, DE (No. 7, 1995)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>The Eagles don’t have a first-round Hall of Famer and won’t for the next few decades, unless someone gets charitable and decides that Donovan McNabb deserves a gold jacket. And while McNabb was the most important player in modern Eagles history (up until three months ago), no one was better than Brown, who made two All-Pro teams in a five-year career that was tragically cut short when he died in a car accident at the age of 27. Mamula wasn’t as awful as the reputation that precedes him, but the fact that Philly took him in the top 10 based mainly on his combine performance – leaving Warren Sapp and Derrick Brooks on the board – was a groundbreaking moment in the history of awful picks.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Washington Redskins</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Darrell Green, CB (No. 28, 1983)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Heath Shuler, QB (No. 3, 1995) </b></p>\n",
      "<p>The amount of candidates for Washington’s worst pick is amazing: Heath Shuler, Desmond Howard, Patrick Ramsey, Robert Griffin III, Michael Westbrook, LaVar Arrington, Carlos Rogers, Bobby Wilson, Andre Johnson and, probably one day, Josh Doctson. What’s exponentially more remarkable is that all those busts have come from just 26 first-round picks. No team that existed before 1995 has made close to 26 – the average is about 48 per team, a handful of teams have made double the picks of the Redskins and only the Bucs and Seahawks (both founded in 1977) have fewer than 40 first-round picks, with 38 and 39, respectively. (The Jags, born in 1995, have made one fewer first-round picks than the Redskins have since the merger.) From 1969 through 1990, Washington made just three first-round picks but made them count: In 1980, Hall of Famer Art Monk was the franchise’s first first-round pick in 12 years. Mark May, a founding member of the Hogs, went in the first round the next year. And in 1983, the team took Green, a tiny speedster from Texas A&amp;I. The rest of Redskins history is, uh, less decorated.</p>\n",

      "<b>Worst pick: Cade McNown, QB (No. 12, 1999)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>Sweetness is one of the great running backs in NFL history. McNown lasted two seasons in Chicago, finished with a 3-12 record, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/26/sports/pro-football-notebook-bears-traded-mcnown-over-his-attitude.html\">alienated teammates</a>, insulted coaches and hated on the press but, other than that, had a successful run.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Detroit Lions</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Barry Sanders, RB (No. 3, 1989) </b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Charles Rogers, WR (No. 2, 2003)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>If you weren’t around to see Jim Brown, then Barry Sanders is likely the greatest running back you’ve ever seen. If he hadn’t retired after 10 seasons, he likely would have put the NFL rushing record into out-of-reach territory. Rogers gets my vote for the worst first-round pick in history because he was the exact opposite of a bad pick. He was a guaranteed star – a safe selection that would surely be catching touchdowns for the Lions for the next decade. Rogers was Randy Moss-like in college, maybe even better. He finished his career with 36 catches and later <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2017/04/19/charles-rogers-says-pain-pills-injuries-ruined-career-not-marijuana/100682576/\">blamed pain pills and injuries for ruining his career.</a></p>\n",

      "<b>Worst pick: Rich Campbell, QB (No. 6, 1981)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>The Packers may have gotten lucky that Aaron Rodgers fell to them in the 2005 draft, but the front office deserves credit for having the foresight to see that Brett Favre would eventually need a successor and that an opportunity to take a guy with No. 1 talent was impossible to pass up. Also key: not trading him for nothing, simply to cater to Favre and praying that the inevitable day of reckoning would somehow never come, NEW ENGLAND.</p>\n",

      "<b>Worst pick: Troy Williams, WR (No. 7, 2005)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>There were more fun picks than these two (Randy Moss and Christian Ponder, respectively) but you can’t argue with either McDaniell or Williams. The first was a first-team All-Pro in seven of his 12 seasons in Minnesota and is in the Hall of Fame. The second was a top-10 pick who averaged 26 catches, 350 yards and 1 touchdown in his three seasons with the Vikes.</p>\n",

      "<p>Before Ryan, the Falcons had eight playoff appearances in 42 seasons. Under the Boston College product, they’ve made it six times in 10 years, including the first back-to-back appearances in franchise history. Though he’s been mostly forgotten because of sports’ obsession with recency bias, Bruce Pickens had long been regarded as one of the league’s great draft busts. He started four games in two-and-a-half seasons with Atlanta, the lowest total for any top-three pick since the AFL/NFL merger.</p>\n",

      "<p>An NFL MVP in 2015, Newton has turned the Panthers from occasional contenders into perennial ones. Julius Peppers was also a great Carolina pick, but he spent some of his best years in Chicago and Green Bay. Rae Carruth has been in prison since 2001 after being convicted on conspiracy charges to murder his pregnant girlfriend (he is expected to be released later this year).</p>\n",

      "<h3>New Orleans Saints</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Willie Roaf, T (No. 8, 1993) </b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Russell Erxleben, P (No. 11, 1979)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>In 1979, the New Orleans Saints made Erxleben the highest-drafted punter in NFL history and the second, and last, to go in the first round. (Ray Guy, the only punter in the Hall of Fame, was the other.) Erxleben’s career was slightly less successful. A three-time All-American punter at Texas (and owner of the longest field goal in NCAA history), he stayed with the Saints for five years before his release. Only once did he finish in the top 10 in the NFL in yards per punt. Since 1979, there’s only been two other punters taken in the second round (and none in the past 22 years). In the 2000s, there’s only been two punters selected in the third round. I’d read a book about the story behind this pick. Well maybe not a book. A tweet – but the 280-character kind.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Derrick Brooks, LB (No. 28, 1995)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Bo Jackson, RB (No. 1, 1986)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>Bo Jackson told the Bucs he wasn’t going to sign if they picked him No. 1 in the ’86 draft. They did it anyway, Bo was true to his word and played baseball. When Tampa’s rights expired, Oakland took Bo in the seventh round in 1987, allowing him to join the team after baseball season.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Arizona Cardinals</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Larry Fitzgerald, WR (No. 3, 2004)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Kelly Stouffer, QB (No. 6, 1987) </b></p>\n",
      "<p>Fitzgerald will retire as one of the most prolific receivers in NFL history and was the offensive centerpiece on a team that came within inches of a Super Bowl title. Stouffer is on the short list of the worst first-round quarterbacks of all time, finishing his career 5-11 with 7 touchdowns, 19 interceptions</p>\n",
      "<h3>Los Angeles Rams</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Jack Youngblood, DE (No. 20, 1971)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Jason Smith, T (No. 2, 2009)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>Youngblood is best known for leading the team to Super Bowl XIV on a broken leg, but that was only a chapter in an equally beastly career that saw him make seven-straight Pro Bowls, five first-team All-Pros and, along the way, started 201 consecutive games. Had sacks been an official stat during his playing days, Youngblood would likely be in the top 10 on the career list. As for Jason Smith, I can’t remember a more anonymous top-three pick of the past decade. He played three seasons in St. Louis before being shipped to the Jets. He was out of the league a year later.</p>\n",
      "<h3>San Francisco 49ers</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Jerry Rice, WR (No. 16, 1985)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Jim Druckenmiller, QB (No. 26, 1997)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>One is arguably the greatest player in NFL history. (It’s not an argument I make, not when part of his greatness is owed to the two men who threw him passes.) The other is arguably the worst first-round quarterback ever. (In terms of numbers, it’s an easy call. No one ever played less than Druck, who made one start and threw just 52 passes in his career. Heck, even Akili Smith got a season’s worth of starts.)</p>\n",
      "<h3>Seattle Seahawks</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Walter Jones, LT (No. 6, 1997)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Rick Mirer, QB (No. 2, 1993)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>Aaron Curry going at No. 4 in 2009 was a laughably bad pick but a quick look at the rest of he first round shows the Seahawks were pretty much cooked either way. So it’s Mirer by default. The Notre Dame star was supposed to be Seattle’s savior and got four seasons to prove it. It was generous to get that much: No first-round QB in the last 25 years who made more than 50 stats had worse numbers.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Buffalo Bills</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Bruce Smith, DE (No. 1, 1985)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Aaron Maybin, DE (No. 11, 2009)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>Smith retired as the all-time leader in sacks with 200 (all but 29 were with Buffalo), making good on the promise he showed when he was taken with the top pick in a loaded 1985 draft. Aaron Maybin was no Bruce Smith <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/education/k-12/bs-md-aaron-maybin-cold-schools-20180108-story.html\">(though he’s made a huge impact on something probably more important than football in his post-NFL career).</a></p>\n",
      "<h3>Miami Dolphins</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Dan Marino, QB (No. 27, 1983)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: David Overstreet, RB (No. 13, 1981) </b></p>\n",
      "<p>Marino made a precipitous drop in the <a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/01/18/When-Dan-Marino-was-coming-out-of-college-his/7140474872400/\">’83 draft thanks to whispers of drug use during his college days at Pitt.</a> Despite the rumors and the presence of David Woodley, a quarterback who was coming off a Super Bowl appearance, Miami took Marino and watched him become the most prolific quarterback in NFL history. Though Overstreet gets the worst pick award, special mention goes to Yatil Green, the hard-luck Miami U receiver selected in 1999 who tore up his knee on the first day of training camp (shades of Ki-Jana Carter), didn’t get on the field until his third year and ended his career with almost as many surgeries (10) as catches (18).</p>\n",
      "<h3>New England Patriots</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: John Hannah, G (No. 4, 1973)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Kenneth Sims, DE (No. 1, 1982) </b></p>\n",
      "<p>Nothing from the era of Belichick and Brady? Nope; the first-round picks from the Pats dynasty have maxed out at “very good” and bottomed at “merely okay.” Hannah was a Hall of Fame guard who had been the best player in Pats history up until that Brady guy. Sims wasn’t horrible, but when you have the No. 1 pick, you expect more than 74 games and five years as a starter. (The best and worst of recent times, in case you were wondering: Richard Seymour and Laurence Maroney, respectively.)</p>\n",
      "<h3>New York Jets</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Darrelle Revis, CB (No. 14, 2007)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Blair Thomas, RB (No. 2, 1990)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>This is as ugly a list as you’d expect. The Jets have picked only one Hall of Famer in the first round and John Riggins made it to Canton based on his later exploits with the Redskins. Revis spent three years as the NFL’s top shutdown corner and even though he only spent six years with the team in his prime (he returned for the last two seasons), it’s enough to put him ahead of guys like Nick Mangold and John Abraham. As for the worst, it’s a rotten cornucopia from which to choose. Thomas, who went No. 2 behind Jeff George in 1990 (oof), wins, a decision that becomes easier when you remember who the second RB drafted was that year – Emmitt Smith.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Baltimore Ravens</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Ray Lewis, LB (No. 26, 1996)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Kyle Boller, QB (No. 19, 2003)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>In the Ravens first year in Baltimore, the team made two first-round selections: Jonathan Ogden at No. 4 and Ray Lewis at No. 26. The former is in the Hall of Fame. The latter will be inducted in four months.</p>\n",

      "<p>The great Munoz, who’s on the short list of the top offensive linemen ever, made nine All-Pro teams in his Hall of Fame career. Every other Bengals first-round pick combined to make seven.

There’s no shortage of potential busts from Cleveland (Brandon Weeden, Brady Quinn, Justin Gilbert, Johnny Manziel, Craig Powell, etc.) but we’ll go with Richardson, who was a sure-thing pick at No. 3 and barely rushed for more than 1,000 yards before getting dumped early in his second year in a baffling trade with the Colts.</p>\n",

      "<b>Worst pick: Huey Richardson, LB (No. 15, 1991)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>The Steelers have only picked inside the top 10 on five occasions since the merger (their first pick of the modern era and their only No. 1 pick was used well – Pittsburgh took Terry Bradshaw first in 1970). That hasn’t stopped the Steelers from getting five Hall of Famers in the top of the draft – Rod Woodson, Bradshaw, Franco Harris, Lynn Swann and, down the road, Roethlisberger. The worst pick isn’t as easy, so we went with Richardson, who had three tackles in his only year in the Steel City.</p>\n",

      "<p>Watt beats out Andre Johnson, a transcendent talent over a Hall of Fame one. The worst pick was harder. David Carr might be most people’s choice but what else were the Texans going to do? They had the No. 1 pick in their first year and needed a quarterback. The possiblities: Carr, Joey Harrington, Patrick Ramsey, Josh McCown, David Garrard, Rohan Davey, Randy Fasani, Kurt Kittner, Brandon Doman, Craig Nall, J.T. O’Sullivan, Steve Bellisari, Seth Burford, Jeff Kelly and Wes Pate. What did you want them to do?</p>\n",

Though Manning had his greatest season in Denver, his 14 years in Indy were more than enough to make him the best Colts player in history. On the other end of the spectrum, Art Schlichter was suspended for gambling on games, never won a start and has spent the rest of his life in and out of jail.</p>\n",

Locker left football after four years for vague reasons. <a href=\"https://www.si.com/nfl/2018/04/18/jake-locker-nfl-2011-draft-tennessee-titans-why-he-quit\">A recent <em>Sports Illustrated</em> article</a> finally told his story – the 26-year-old didn’t enjoy playing in the NFL and decided that his family and his religion were more important.

      "<p>Putting Tebow here wasn’t a no-brainer.

      "<p>The second QB taken in the historic 1983 draft was Blackledge, the Penn State star who was taken six picks after John Elway went No. 1 for a team for which he’d never play. Kansas City, of course, missed out on Jim Kelly and Dan Marino. But with Tony Eason and Ken O’Brien also going in the first round, the Chiefs had only a 40% chance of taking a Hall of Famer. Problem is, the Chiefs got the worst of the litter. Blackledge made just 24 starts in KC.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Los Angeles Chargers</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Junior Seau, LB (No. 5, 1990)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Ryan Leaf, QB (No. 2, 1998)</b></p>\n",
      "<p>Seau played 13 seasons in San Diego, making the Pro Bowl in his final 12 and being named an All-Pro in eight (six first-team selections, two second-team). Leaf played three seasons in San Diego, winning four games in total and throwing for 20 more interceptions than touchdowns.</p>\n",
      "<h3>Oakland Raiders</h3>\n",
      "<p><b>Best pick: Tim Brown, WR (No. 6, 1988)</b><br/>\n",
      "<b>Worst pick: Todd Marinovich, QB (No. 24, 1991) </b></p>\n",
      "<p>Marinovich is one of the great cautionary tales in sport, showing that for every Tiger Woods or Williams sister who makes good on the borderline sporting abuse of overbearing fathers, there’s an opposite outcome that ends in tragedy. Brown, the first wide receiver to win the Heisman Trophy, was practically molded from an Al Davis dream – a fast, reliable receiver with soft hands who looked good in a football uniform. He was one of the NFL’s greats of the 1990s, the third man to grab 1,000 catches and a Hall of Famer.</p>\n",

The 2004 third overall pick has caught 325 passes since turning 32 in 2015, and he's still going. Overall, the 11-time Pro Bowler ranks third all-time with 1,234 receptions and 15,545 receiving yards. Fitzgerald should eclipse <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/terrell-owens\">Terrell Owens</a>' 15,934 receiving yards during the 2018 campaign and take second place. The 6'3\", 218-pound target came into the league making acrobatic catches before developing into an ideal slot receiver later in his career. He made the transition because he's an exceptional route-runner with velcro for hands. </p><p>                <br/><br/><strong>Worst: Steve Little</strong></p><p>Only five specialists have been first-round picks in the Super Bowl era. Normally, kickers and punters wouldn't even be included in this conversation. Yet Little's awful three-year career must be noted. Roberto Aguayo falls on the butt end of many jokes after being a 2016 second-round pick of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and struggling. Imagine taking a specialist in the first round only to have him convert 48.1 percent of his field-goal attempts and average 38.5 yards per punt. The Cardinals don't have to imagine after wasting the 15th overall pick in 1978 on one. </p></ol></div><div class=\"organism contentStream slide\" id=\"slide2\"><div class=\"ad\"><div class=\"lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert\"><div class=\"br-ad-lazy\" data-collapsed=\"1\" data-country=\"US\" data-position=\"rect_atf_02\" data-reload=\"1\" data-responsive-size='[[[970,0],[\"fluid\",[970,250],[970,66],[728,90],[300,250]]],[[728,0],[\"fluid\",[728,90],[300,250]]],[[0,0],[\"fluid\",[300,250],[320,50]]]]' data-size=\"[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]\" id=\"br-ad-2767040-2\"></div></div></div><h1>Atlanta Falcons</h1><div class=\"slideData\">2 of 32</div><ol><div class=\"atom photo\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"><p></p><div class=\"imgWrapper\"><div class=\"atom deferredImage\"><img class=\"placeholder\" data-original-src=\"https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/slides/photos/004/297/412/ca4bfe621a76300f574aef2e909dc3a1_crop_exact.jpg?h=533&amp;w=800&amp;q=70&amp;crop_x=center&amp;crop_y=top\" height=\"533\" itemprop=\"contentUrl\" src=\"https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png\" width=\"800\"/></div></div><small><span class=\"caption\"></span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"citation\">Mitchell Layton/Getty Images</span></small></div><p><strong>Best: Mike Kenn</strong></p><p>Deion Sanders is the flashiest draft pick in Atlanta Falcons history. <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/julio-jones\">Julio Jones</a> has a chance to be the greatest.

The linebacker has the edge over the left tackle as the franchise's greatest pick thanks his value as the 26th overall selection. That, and longevity. Lewis played 17 seasons to Ogden's 12, earned 13 Pro Bowl nods, garnered two NFL Defensive Player of the Year awards, became a two-time Super Bowl champion and captured the Super Bowl XXXV MVP award. The middle linebacker served as the physical and spiritual leader of one of the greatest defenses in NFL history when the Ravens allowed only 10.3 points per game during the 2000 campaign. </p><p>          <br/><br/><strong>Worst: Kyle Boller</strong></p><p>Prior to the current collective bargaining agreement, organizations were frightened to select the wrong quarterback prospect because it would set the franchise back years due to financial implications. Yet the Ravens traded up to select Boller with the 19th overall pick in the 2003 draft despite indicators he couldn't develop into a starting-caliber quarterback. Boller completed a woeful 47.8 percent of his passes at Cal. But, hey, he could throw ball 50 yards through the uprights <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWMpIMiF7gw\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">from his knees</a>.

O.J. Simpson and Smith were exceptional selections, while a third will be discussed in the next section. Smith developed into the NFL's greatest sack artist after he was drafted in 1985. Of his 200 career sacks, 171 came with Buffalo. The '90s Bills were littered with talent, hence their four straight Super Bowl berths. But Smith was the driving force behind an underappreciated defense. The defensive end went to 11 Pro Bowls, had eight All-Pro nods and took two NFL Defensive Player of the Year awards. </p><p>            <br/><br/><strong>Worst: Tom Cousineau</strong></p><p>At one point, the CFL challenged the NFL for top talent. The Bills selected Cousineau with the No. 1 overall pick in the 1979 draft. The linebacker never played a down for the organization. Instead, he signed with the Montreal Alouettes, because the CFL franchise offered more money. The Bills retained Cousineau's rights and traded him to the Cleveland Browns once he went to the NFL in 1982. All was not lost, though, since the first-round pick the Bills got turned into Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly. </p></ol></div><div class=\"organism contentStream slide\" id=\"slide5\"><div class=\"ad\"><div class=\"lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert\"><div class=\"br-ad-lazy loaded\" data-collapsed=\"1\" data-country=\"US\" data-google-query-id=\"CIWk-c6e9-cCFcnHwAodpEEC8A\" data-position=\"rect_atf_03\" data-reload=\"1\" data-responsive-size='[[[970,0],[\"fluid\",[970,250],[970,66],[728,90],[300,250]]],[[728,0],[\"fluid\",[728,90],[300,250]]],[[0,0],[\"fluid\",[300,250],[320,50]]]]' data-size=\"[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]\" id=\"br-ad-2767040-5\"><div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8663477/BR/NFL/slideshow_2__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none; margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 0px;\"><iframe data-google-container-id=\"3\" data-integralas-id-25238953-1fd2-b83c-453e-e49c6f54bd9f=\"\" data-integralas-id-f7d57252-7309-d5e9-3b1f-1523f9289209=\"\" data-load-complete=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"90\" id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8663477/BR/NFL/slideshow_2\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/8663477/BR/NFL/slideshow_2\" scrolling=\"no\" srcdoc=\"\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"728\"></iframe></div></div></div></div><h1>Carolina Panthers</h1><div class=\"slideData\">5 of 32</div><ol><div class=\"atom photo\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"><p></p><div class=\"imgWrapper\"><div class=\"atom deferredImage\"><img class=\"placeholder\" data-original-src=\"https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/slides/photos/004/297/415/af4bacabaa724a5df323b93a1109638c_crop_exact.jpg?h=533&amp;w=800&amp;q=70&amp;crop_x=center&amp;crop_y=top\" height=\"533\" itemprop=\"contentUrl\" src=\"https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png\" width=\"800\"/></div></div><small><span class=\"caption\"></span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"citation\">Mike McCarn/Associated Press</span></small></div><p><strong>Best: Julius Peppers</strong></p><p>When Peppers re-signed with the Carolina Panthers in 2017 after sevens seasons away from the organization, most expected a nice reunion tour as his career wound to a close. Nothing could have been further from the truth. The 2002 second overall pick tied for 11th overall last season with 11 sacks. The defensive end has eclipsed 10 or more sacks in 10 of his 16 seasons. The 38-year-old ranks fourth all-time with 154.5 sacks, and he will surpass Kevin Greene for third with six more.

Munoz is the franchise's greatest player and arguably the best to ever play left tackle. His journey to becoming an 11-time Pro Bowl and nine-time All-Pro performer is amazing since the 6'6\", 278-pounder was considered an injury risk coming into the league after dealing with knee issues at USC.

David Klinger (1992) and Ki-Jana Carter (1995) are worthy of mention. However, Smith spent four years in Cincinnati and managed only five touchdown passes and 13 interceptions. The 1999 third overall pick flashed talent late in his Oregon Ducks career, and NFL scouts drooled over his potential as an athlete who could spin the ball well. The quarterback never developed as a passer and completed only 46.6 percent of his NFL attempts.<strong><br/></strong></p></ol></div><div class=\"organism contentStream slide\" id=\"slide8\"><div class=\"ad\"><div class=\"lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert\"><div class=\"br-ad-lazy\" data-collapsed=\"1\" data-country=\"US\" data-position=\"rect_atf_03\" data-reload=\"1\" data-responsive-size='[[[970,0],[\"fluid\",[970,250],[970,66],[728,90],[300,250]]],[[728,0],[\"fluid\",[728,90],[300,250]]],[[0,0],[\"fluid\",[300,250],[320,50]]]]' data-size=\"[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]\" id=\"br-ad-2767040-8\"></div></div></div><h1>Cleveland Browns</h1><div class=\"slideData\">8 of 32</div><ol><div class=\"atom photo\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"><p></p><div class=\"imgWrapper\"><div class=\"atom deferredImage\"><img class=\"placeholder\" data-original-src=\"https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/slides/photos/004/297/418/ca757fd9c3d561eb0ee3c891d020d8ce_crop_exact.jpg?h=533&amp;w=800&amp;q=70&amp;crop_x=center&amp;crop_y=top\" height=\"533\" itemprop=\"contentUrl\" src=\"https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/deferredImage/placeholder.png\" width=\"800\"/></div></div><small><span class=\"caption\"></span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"citation\">David Richard/Associated Press</span></small></div><p><strong>Best: Joe Thomas</strong></p><p>Thomas will forever be remembered as the NFL's ironman after playing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/browns/status/922568418267500544\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">10,363</a> straight snaps before his career ended in 2017.

But Upshaw was also one of the best guards to ever play. The five-time first-team All-Pro selection possessed a unique blend of athleticism and attitude. According to Bleacher Report's <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2036826-speed-was-the-all-consuming-obsession-of-al-davis-raiders\" target=\"_blank\">Dan Pompei</a>, the 6'5\", 255-pound blocker ran a 4.6-second 40-yard dash, which allowed him to excel as a pulling guard. He also did everything to bury or frighten his opponents. Upshaw was well worth the 17th pick in the 1967 draft, since he's the first individual in the sport's history to play in Super Bowls during three different decades. </span></span></span></p><p>         <br/><br/><strong>Worst: JaMarcus Russell</strong></p><p>Former Raiders owner <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/al-davis\">Al Davis</a> built his entire scouting philosophy on getting the biggest, fastest and toughest players available.

Unfortunately, all of the quarterback's physical tools didn't translate to the field, because the 2007 No. 1 overall pick lacked the inner drive to realize his potential.

The San Francisco 49ers traded up in the 1985 draft to select the Mississippi Valley State receiver with the 16th overall pick despite concerns over his speed. In spite of a slow start to his professional career, Rice proved he was a perfect fit in Bill Walsh's burgeoning West Coast offense. The bricklayer's son left the NFL with numerous records.

       " <p>Once the games begin, each of the top selections undertakes a divergent path based on numerous factors including situation, coaching staff, fit and everything that encompasses being a professional athlete. </p>,\n",
       " <p>Organizations hope they find a quality starter. None expect a Hall of Fame-caliber performer. Yet a lucky few emerge. Each of the 32 franchises made at least one of these selections in the opening frame since the Super Bowl era began in 1966. </p>,\n",
       " <p>Then, there are those everyone wants to forget. Amazing talents that, for whatever reason, never clicked and live in infamy. The league's worst draft picks won't find their busts in Canton. They're simply busts. </p>,\n",

Fitzgerald should eclipse <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/terrell-owens\">Terrell Owens</a>' 15,934 receiving yards during the 2018 campaign and take second place. The 6'3\", 218-pound target came into the league making acrobatic catches before developing into an ideal slot receiver later in his career. He made the transition because he's an exceptional route-runner with velcro for hands. </p>,\n",

Yet Little's awful three-year career must be noted. Roberto Aguayo falls on the butt end of many jokes after being a 2016 second-round pick of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and struggling. Imagine taking a specialist in the first round only to have him convert 48.1 percent of his field-goal attempts and average 38.5 yards per punt. The Cardinals don't have to imagine after wasting the 15th overall pick in 1978 on one. </p>,\n",

The left tackle went to five Pro Bowls and earned two All-Pro nominations. At 6'7\" and 286 pounds, Kenn separated himself with athleticism. Hall of Fame head coach <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Kenn#cite_note-11\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Walsh said</a> of Kenn in a <span>Falcons media guide</span>, <span>\"I've never seen any offensive tackle with his agility and quickness.\" </span></p>,\n",

Given that he was <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1988/draft.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">selected</a> before Tim Brown and Michael Irvin along with five other first-rounders who earned Pro Bowl honors, Bruce's futility became even more glaring. </p>,\n",

The linebacker has the edge over the left tackle as the franchise's greatest pick thanks his value as the 26th overall selection. That, and longevity. Lewis played 17 seasons to Ogden's 12, earned 13 Pro Bowl nods, garnered two NFL Defensive Player of the Year awards, became a two-time Super Bowl champion and captured the Super Bowl XXXV MVP award. The middle linebacker served as the physical and spiritual leader of one of the greatest defenses in NFL history when the Ravens allowed only 10.3 points per game during the 2000 campaign. </p>,\n",

Yet the Ravens traded up to select Boller with the 19th overall pick in the 2003 draft despite indicators he couldn't develop into a starting-caliber quarterback. Boller completed a woeful 47.8 percent of his passes at Cal. But, hey, he could throw ball 50 yards through the uprights <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWMpIMiF7gw\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">from his knees</a>.

O.J. Simpson and Smith were exceptional selections, while a third will be discussed in the next section. Smith developed into the NFL's greatest sack artist after he was drafted in 1985. Of his 200 career sacks, 171 came with Buffalo. The '90s Bills were littered with talent, hence their four straight Super Bowl berths. But Smith was the driving force behind an underappreciated defense. The defensive end went to 11 Pro Bowls, had eight All-Pro nods and took two NFL Defensive Player of the Year awards. </p>,\n",

       " <p>At one point, the CFL challenged the NFL for top talent. The Bills selected Cousineau with the No. 1 overall pick in the 1979 draft. The linebacker never played a down for the organization. Instead, he signed with the Montreal Alouettes, because the CFL franchise offered more money. The Bills retained Cousineau's rights and traded him to the Cleveland Browns once he went to the NFL in 1982. All was not lost, though, since the first-round pick the Bills got turned into Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly. </p>,\n",

       " <p><strong>Best: Julius Peppers</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p>When Peppers re-signed with the Carolina Panthers in 2017 after sevens seasons away from the organization, most expected a nice reunion tour as his career wound to a close. Nothing could have been further from the truth. The 2002 second overall pick tied for 11th overall last season with 11 sacks. The defensive end has eclipsed 10 or more sacks in 10 of his 16 seasons. The 38-year-old ranks fourth all-time with 154.5 sacks, and he will surpass Kevin Greene for third with six more. Peppers, a nine-time Pro Bowler, registered 92 of those sacks in a Panthers uniform.  </p>,\n",

       " <p>What Carruth did is almost too heinous to even include him, because his failures as a human being extend far beyond the football field. The wide receiver showed promise as a rookie before his life spiraled out of control. The 1997 first-rounder caught 44 passes for 545 yards in his first year before breaking his foot in the following season's opener. In 2001, Carruth was <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/20/sports/sp-14719\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">found guilty</a> of c<span>onspiracy to commit<span> </span></span>first-degree<span><span> </span>murder, shooting into an occupied vehicle and using an instrument to destroy an unborn child.

His gracefulness helped him earn the nickname Sweetness, even though he finished his runs with authority. The 1975 fourth overall pick still ranks in the top four overall in attempts, rushing yardage, rushing touchdowns and all-purpose yards. Payton, the person, will always be remembered, since the NFL hands out the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, which <span>honors a player's volunteer and charity work, as well as his on-field excellence.</span></span></p>,\n",

       " <p>Enis never realized his potential during a short-lived, injury-plagued career. The Bears drafted the Penn State running back with 1995's fifth overall pick, hoping he could become the next Payton. Unfortunately, Enis never started more than 12 games and didn't break the 1,000-yard plateau in his three seasons before taking an early retirement. To make matters worse, the Jacksonville Jaguars selected fellow running back Fred Taylor, who ran for 11,695 career yards, four picks later. </p>,\n",

       " <p>The Cincinnati Bengals drafted only one Hall of Fame inductee since the organization began in 1968. Munoz is the franchise's greatest player and arguably the best to ever play left tackle. His journey to becoming an 11-time Pro Bowl and nine-time All-Pro performer is amazing since the 6'6\", 278-pounder was considered an injury risk coming into the league after dealing with knee issues at USC. Cincinnati still used 1980's third overall pick to secure the franchise cornerstone. Munoz started all 16 games in eight of his 13 seasons and became the standard by which all future blindside protectors are measured.</p>,\n",

       " <p><strong>Worst: Akili Smith</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p>The Bengals produced a string of terrible first-round busts during the 1990s. David Klinger (1992) and Ki-Jana Carter (1995) are worthy of mention. However, Smith spent four years in Cincinnati and managed only five touchdown passes and 13 interceptions. The 1999 third overall pick flashed talent late in his Oregon Ducks career, and NFL scouts drooled over his potential as an athlete who could spin the ball well. The quarterback never developed as a passer and completed only 46.6 percent of his NFL attempts.<strong><br/></strong></p>,\n",

The left tackle earned nine All-Pro (first and second team) nominations thanks to incomparable technique. Every pass set looked the same over 11 seasons. Thomas joined <span>Merlin Olsen, Mel Renfro, Barry Sanders and Lawrence Taylor as the only players in NFL history to make 10 straight Pro Bowls to start their careers. The fact Thomas never played for a playoff team won't stop him from entering the Pro Football Hall of Fame soon. </span></p>,\n",

       " <p>So many options were available, since the Browns have been a bust factory. Yet the worst came in 1987 when the franchise traded for the fifth overall pick—sending linebacker Chip Banks and its first- and second-round selections to the San Diego Chargers—and chose Junkin, who then-scout Dom Anile infamously <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140330082102/http://espncleveland.com/common/more.php?m=49&amp;post_id=881\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">compared to</a> a \"mad dog in a meat market.\" Junkin played two seasons in Cleveland and never found a regular role among its linebacker corps before being traded to the Kansas City Chiefs for a fifth-round pick. </p>,\n",

Smith left the game as a three-time Super Bowl champion, a Super Bowl XXVIII and NFL MVP (1993), an eight-time Pro Bowler and four-time first-team All-Pro. Consistency and availability matter. Smith ran for more than 1,000 yards 11 times to etch his name in the record book.</p>,\n",
       " <p>          <br/><br/><strong>Worst: Bill Thomas</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p>Dallas' rich history of drafting started with Tex Schramm, Tom Landry and Gil Brandt. Thomas is the closest thing to a complete swing and miss a team can experience. Worried about Calvin Hill's health, the Cowboys used their 1972 first-round pick (26th overall) to select another running back. Thomas played one season in Dallas, suffered a shoulder injury and never carried the ball before being released. <strong><br/></strong></p>,\n",
       " <p></p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Best: Von Miller</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p>At 29 years old, Miller is the youngest player on this list. Despite his relative youth, the outside linebacker's impact on the Denver Broncos can't be questioned. The 2011 second overall pick made an immediate positive impression by winning the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year award after registering 11.5 sacks. In fact, Miller picked up at least 10 sacks in all but one of his seven seasons and became the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Broncos/status/922276849257984000\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">second-fastest</a> in NFL history to amass 80 sacks. As a result, the outside linebacker has been honored with six Pro Bowl and three All-Pro nods. Yet his career will be defined by a dominant Super Bowl 50 performance, which garnered the him game's MVP award. </p>,\n",
       " <p>          <br/><br/><strong>Worst: Tommy Maddox</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p>The Broncos drafted Maddox with 1992's 25th pick to be John Elway's replacement. The team obviously didn't think enough of its franchise quarterback, since Elway played until 1998 and brought the organization its first two Super Bowl victories during his final two seasons. Maddox, meanwhile, was off the Broncos roster after the 1993 campaign and ended up in the XFL before finding a home with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2001. The ill-advised first-round pick provided the Broncos with 758 passing yards, six touchdowns and nine interceptions.    </p>,\n",

       " <p>Sanders' <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy1JjDq5lz8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">highlight reel</a> is unlike anything else in the NFL. The most elusive runner in football history made professional tacklers, 300-pound defensive linemen and secondary speed demons looked like kids on the playground flailing to stop the neighborhood's best athlete. Sanders routinely turned negative plays into big gains on his way to 15,269 yards as the NFL's third all-time leading rusher. The No. 3 pick in 1989 may have been the greatest running back in league history, but he abruptly retired after 10 seasons. The 1988 Heisman Trophy winner rushed for at least 1,115 yards and earned first- or second-team All-Pro honors every year he played. </p>,\n",

But the Lions expected more than 36 receptions for 440 yards in three seasons from 2003's second overall selection. Rogers can be blamed for three <span>violations of the NFL's substance abuse policy.

The top-10 overall talent took a nosedive in the first round of the 2005 NFL draft before the Green Bay Packers selected him with the 24th overall pick. Now, he's arguably professional football's best quarterback and has unparalleled arm talent and pocket creativity. Tom Brady has the most notoriety, yet Rodgers is the game's most talented signal-caller. After sitting for three years behind Favre, Rodgers racked up 312 touchdowns compared to 77 interceptions in 10 seasons.

Matuszak signed with the Oilers and the World Football League's Houston Texans. Oilers representation took umbrage with the idea and served Matuszak <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1989/06/19/football-player-john-matuszak-dies-at-age-38/507757a0-9684-44c8-853b-c285c9faf559/?utm_term=.12a5728f1dbf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">with an injunction</a> to prevent him from playing with the Texans. The Oilers front office became upset about the situation and traded the defensive lineman to the Kansas City Chiefs. Eventually, Matuszak became a standout performer for the Oakland Raiders, but he never played a down for the Oilers. </p>,\n",

       " <p><strong>Best: Darrell Green</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p>Generally speaking, the Washington Redskins capitalized on their draft selections since the organization traded away more first-round picks than any other franchise in the Super Bowl era. Since 1966, Washington didn't make a first-round selection in an astonishing 25 draft classes. The team chose one prospect, Green, in the opening frame from 1982 through 1990, though it maximized its value since the cornerback played 20 seasons and ranks seventh all-time with 258 starts. Considered the <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-network-top-ten/0ap3000000558874/Darrell-Green-Top-10-Fastest-Players\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fastest player</a> in NFL history, Green earned seven Pro Bowl bids and one first-team All-Pro nomination thanks to his coverage skills. </p>,\n",
       " <p>      </p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Worst: Heath Shuler</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p>Shuler proved to be a more successful politician than a football player. The North Carolina native's six years in the United States House of Representatives surpasses his four-year playing career. Washington selected Shuler with the third overall pick in the 1994 draft. The organization chose Gus Frerotte 194 picks later, and the seventh-round selection outplayed his first-round counterpart. During Shuler's three seasons in Washington, the quarterback completed 47.7 percent of his passes with a 13-19 touchdown-to-interception ratio. <strong><br/></strong></p>]"
